# Closed Public Square Cost Calculator
Cleveland's Public Square was recently re-built for bus traffic to flow through the center.  Mayor Jackson's administration is rerouting buses around the square because some people object to public transit.  The Regional Transit Authority, which has already had to make service cuts and raise fares due to lack of state funding, is facing an additional $1.55 million each year in costs due to this reroute.
