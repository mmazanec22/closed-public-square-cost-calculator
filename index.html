      <p class = "quote">"Although the original plan was to resume RTA bus service on Superior Avenue through Public Square on Aug. 1, the City of Cleveland and RTA are in discussions regarding when and if the buses will be allowed to use the designed, exclusive transit lanes."</p>

      <p class = "quote">(See Scenario D cost and Scenario H cost in the image on the right.  We subtracted the first figure from the second and arrived at the annual cost of $1.55 million.)</p>

      <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2014/08/the_public_square_debate_rtas.html">Why is this a problem?</a>
      <p class = "quote">"Calabrese said that removing buses from the square, or relegating them to the outer roads, would be out of the question. RTA currently runs about 4,000 buses through the square daily, he said. The big civic space remains a critically important hub because of the concentration of jobs in downtown Cleveland, and because of the square's proximity to the Red, Blue and Green rapid transit lines that converge in Tower City Center nearby."</p>
